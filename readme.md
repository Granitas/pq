# pq

`pq` is a command line xml and json processor for xpath and css selectors, inspired by [`jq`](https://github.com/stedolan/jq). 

`pq` uses [`parsel`](https://github.com/scrapy/parsel) with the help of [`dicttoxml`](https://github.com/quandyfactory/dicttoxml) to parse `json` or `xml` files using **xpath** or **css selectors**.
